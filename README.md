# krs-dam-simulator
A command-line Java application that simulates the daily water level management of the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) Dam. This interactive simulation models water inflow, user-controlled outflow, and triggers alerts based on predefined rules, providing a hands-on exercise in object-oriented programming, state management, and conditional logic.
